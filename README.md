The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) is the open standard for connecting AI
assistants to tools and data. This repository is two things:

1. **A directory** — a curated, categorized list of MCP servers the community has built and shipped.
2. **A teaching repo** — small, readable server implementations in Python you can clone, run, and copy from.

Built and maintained by [AI Anytime](https://www.youtube.com/@AIAnytime). Additions come from the community — see [Contributing](#-contributing).

## 🧱 Servers in this repo

Reference implementations you can run locally. Each folder is self-contained — open it and follow its `README.md`.

| Server | What it does | Stack |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`weather`](./weather) | Active US weather alerts by state and short-term forecasts by lat/long, from the National Weather Service API. | Python · stdio |
| [`linkedin-profile-mcp`](./linkedin-profile-mcp) | Fetches LinkedIn profile data as JSON through the Fresh LinkedIn Profile Data API on RapidAPI. | Python · stdio · needs `RAPIDAPI_KEY` |
| [`pubmed-mcp-server`](./pubmed-mcp-server) | Searches PubMed and returns article abstracts, via BioPython's Entrez module. | Python · stdio |
| [`mcp-wiki`](./mcp-wiki) | Reads a Wikipedia article and hands it back as clean Markdown. | Python · stdio |
| [`http-sse-mcp-starter`](./http-sse-mcp-starter) | Starter template for a **remote** MCP server over HTTP/SSE (Starlette + FastMCP), with a matching client. | Python · SSE |
| [`streamlit as an MCP Host`](./streamlit%20as%20an%20MCP%20Host) | Streamlit app acting as an MCP **host** — connects to an SSE server, calls its tools, summarizes with a local Ollama model. | Python · Streamlit |

> [!TIP]
> New to MCP? Read `weather` first (smallest surface area), then `http-sse-mcp-starter` to see the same
> idea served remotely, then `streamlit as an MCP Host` to see the other side of the wire.

## 🚀 Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AIAnytime/Awesome-MCP-Server.git
cd Awesome-MCP-Server/weather

uv sync              # or: pip install -r requirements.txt
uv run weather.py
```

Then point an MCP client at it. With Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add weather -- uv --directory /absolute/path/to/Awesome-MCP-Server/weather run weather.py
```

For Claude Desktop, add the same command to `claude_desktop_config.json` under `mcpServers`.
Stuck? The [MCP playlist on the AI Anytime YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@AIAnytime) walks through it end to end.

## 🌍 Community directory

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are very welcome — this list is only as good as the people adding to it.

**Adding a server?** Read **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** first. The short version:

- One server per pull request.
- Add it as a **bullet** in the right category, in alphabetical order. Please don't renumber anything or introduce numbered lists.
- Use the exact entry format:
  ```markdown
  - **[Name](https://link-to-repo-or-docs)** `stdio|http|sse` — One sentence on what it does. Install: `command` · [Docs](https://…)
  ```
- Keep it to one or two sentences. No marketing copy, no tracking parameters in URLs.
- The server must actually exist, speak MCP, and be reachable by someone who isn't you.
